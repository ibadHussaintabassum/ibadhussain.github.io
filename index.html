    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence
        and prompt-based interaction with AI tools. I am currently learning programming
        fundamentals and exploring how well-structured prompts can improve AI responses
        for learning, productivity, and problem solving.

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>
       My long-term goal is to grow into a person who can bridge human thought and intelligent systems. I want to deeply understand how people think, communicate, and express ideas—and then use that understanding to interact with AI in a meaningful, ethical, and practical way.

Rather than rushing to become an “expert,” my focus is on building strong foundations: learning continuously, improving how I ask questions, and refining how I guide AI tools to support learning, creativity, and problem-solving.

Alongside technical growth, I aim to strengthen my communication, debating, and public speaking skills so I can explain complex ideas clearly, represent ideas confidently, and contribute positively in collaborative environments.

In the future, I want to be known not just for using technology, but for using it responsibly, thoughtfully, and with purpose—as someone who learns deeply, communicates clearly, and helps others make sense of complex systems.
